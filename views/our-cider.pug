								h2 Premiere Act II
								p Based on the success of our original Premiere, we recreated our first cider with more complexities but using the same traditional techniques. Expect a very dry cider with some more body and a slightly bitter finish, reminiscent of apple skin.

								p Our first cider made of Campbellâ€™s own Empire, Red Delicious, Brandywine Crabapple, Flemish Beauty and Bosc pears that make up the entirety of this cider.

								h2 Heritage & Cherry
								p On a dark winter night, Colin Campbell was rummaging around in the cider house. In his clumsiness (he may have been sampling too much cider) he accidentally knocked a bucket of sour cherries into a batch of #[strong Heritage] cider. The result was a delicious cider with a subtle hint of cherry tartness.

								h2 Heritage
								p Our Heritage variety is made with late-season apples like Northern Spys and Golden Russets. This provides a more full-bodied cider that sticks to your tongue. We also blended each of our Heritage varieties with Prince Edward County maple syrup.
